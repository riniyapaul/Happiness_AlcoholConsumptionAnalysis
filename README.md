The Happiness and Alcohol Consumption project explores the relationship between alcohol consumption and happiness across different countries. Using multivariate statistical techniques, the study examines how different types of alcohol consumption (beer, wine, and spirits) correlate with happiness scores and economic indicators like GDP per capita and Human Development Index (HDI). The dataset, collected from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte â€“ Data Science and Business Analytics website, includes data from 122 countries with five key variables: HDI, GDP per Capita, Beer per Capita, Spirit per Capita, and Wine per Capita. Methodologies such as descriptive statistics, cluster analysis, multidimensional scaling, principal component analysis, and factor analysis were employed to analyze the data. Results indicate that Germany and Czech Republic rank among the happiest countries due to alcohol consumption, while Senegal and Mali have lower happiness scores. Among the variables, Wine Per Capita has the most significant impact on happiness scores. To replicate the analysis, install the necessary dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt, open the Jupyter Notebook or script, execute the data preprocessing and statistical analysis steps, and interpret the visualizations and results.
